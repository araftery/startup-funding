Our code may be found in the repository whose README you're currently reading. :p

Our process book is the PDF file in this repository called `process_book.pdf`, and our write up of the Final Project Design Studio is the PDF in this repository called `design_studio_feedback.pdf`.

Our screencast is hosted on YouTube and available at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhJaefD0Fak][2].

The folder in this repository called `old` contains the code from our first version of our project and is included for reference only.
